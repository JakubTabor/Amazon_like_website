# I gonna make place order button in checkout.js interactive
* Once we click it it will take our cart and turn it into an order
* And i gonna use backend to create an order 
* First i add event listener for place order buton

# I specify that once we click it will send request to the backend
* We need to send a data to the backend, which will be our cart
* For that we use POST request and headers, which will be an object 
* This header gives the backend more information about our request
* We specify what type of data we are sending in our request
* And body, which is actual data that we are sending, it will be cart array converted into JSON string

# I need to use async await, to wait for the response to come back
* And i save the responnse in a variable

# Once i created an order i need to save it somewhere, so i create orders.js
* First i create an array in which i gonna contain all of my orders
* Then i create function for adding the orders to this array 
* To add the most recent order at the top we use unshift(order)

# I also add if there are some error with network it display a message
* And after we create an order we go to the orders page using window.location
* It let us control the URL at the top of the browser
