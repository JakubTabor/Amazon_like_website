# Fetch is better way to make HTTP requests, because it is simpler
* XMLHttpRequest use colback for request to the backend
* fetch() use promise to make requests

# To make request with a fetch we use built in function fetch()
* It make HTTP request and default version of request in GET, we just need to pass url

# We can add another step to that promise using .then() and the response will be saved in parameter
* To get the data from the product from response we use .json()
* But .json() is asynchronous, it returns a promise, to wait for the promise to finish, inside .then() we can return another promise
* When we return a promise, it will wait for that promise to finish before go to the next step

# Whats also good, that it return is already converted json string into an array of products
