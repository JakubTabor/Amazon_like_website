# Now instead of using file to load the product i gonna use backend
* I gonna use function to load that products 
* The response is JSON, so we use JSON.parse to convert it to JS array
* And it become our products variable, now we can convert it into a class

# But we need to remember, that we need to load the response and then run that function
* First we load the products, using products rendering grid as a parameter of loadProducts function
* So i specify the parameter (fun) that we can pass to the loadProducts function
* And that run the function  

# The function that we provide to loadProducts function is called colback
* So we are giving it a function to run/call in the future
