# Now instead of using file to load the product i gonna use backend
* I gonna use function to load that products 
* The response is JSON, so we use JSON.parse to convert it to JS array
* And it become our products variable, now we can convert it into a class

# But we need to remember, that we need to load the response and then run that function
* First we load the products, using products rendering grid as a parameter of loadProducts function
* So i specify the parameter (fun) that we can pass to the loadProducts function
* And that run the function  

# The function that we provide to loadProducts function is called colback
* So we are giving it a function to run/call in the future
* And we do the same in checkout.js we save render order and payment summary inside parameter (fun)
* Then we gonna call (fun) after we load the products 

# I gonna make place order button in checkout.js interactive
* Once we click it it will take our cart and turn it into an order
* And i gonna use backend to create an order 
* First i add event listener
