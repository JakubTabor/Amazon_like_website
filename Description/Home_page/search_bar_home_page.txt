# Now i gonna make the search bar functional
* I start from creating two variables url and search, they will help me get the products i search for
* And make the condition if there is a search, the words related to the product will return me all this products
* It's more simple to just write one word and get all things related to it  

# And i add the forEach loop for this all filtered products, to the part of HTML code generation

# In final part i use querySelector to add the action once i click to search button
* It will make search and give me the value (all searched products) on main page
