# To make our delivery cart interactive, first we need to update deliveryOptionId in the cart array
* First we need to know the product to update and delivery option that we choose
* So i loop through the cart to find the product and update deliveryoptionId of that product 
* I already have code that give me cart item that matches product id and save it inside a variable
* And i update delivery option id property, now i can save it to local storage

# And next i add event listeners to delivery buttons once i click them
* I take product id and delivery option out of data to get access to it

# And i can update the page, once we select delivery option
* So once we select an option i need to rerun the code and re-generate the html
