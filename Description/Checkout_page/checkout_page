# First in checkout.html we need to add javaScript to generate the HTML code
* We can use id to seach for all other details of the product Normalizing the data 

# So i create all the same features just like for amazon.js page
* I import cart and products to create 2 loops 
* One to get all products and its all data
* And next to check if product id match the product from cart and save it inside a variable

# Then i pass the HTML for cart item and pass flexible values
* Using DOM i move current order summary into JavaScript

# Next i make for each product to choose its own delivery option
