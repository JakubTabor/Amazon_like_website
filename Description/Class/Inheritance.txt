# Inheritance is useful when we have a product and specific type or property of product
* Inheritance feature allow one class to get all properties and methods from another class
* The class from which another class inherit is called parent class
* And class which inheritate is called child class 

# So por example Cloathing will be specific type of Product class
* To inherit all methods and properties we use extends (and name of class that we want to inherited from)

# Inheritance let us reuse code between classes 
* I gonna use it in the project to add size chart 
* To avoid adding once again product details, such as id, image itd. we can use feature (super)
* super call constructor of parent class 

# If we don't create constructor in child class, it will run by default parent class constructor
