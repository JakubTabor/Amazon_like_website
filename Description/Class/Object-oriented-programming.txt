# This type of programming is organizing our code into objects
* We can use property called (this), it give us an object that contain certain function
* I group all my functions inside an created object 

# Object oriented programming is useful when we want to create multiply objects
* We just need to copy of an object and introduce the changes

# Instead of copy pasting we can write function to create objects
* And to avoid that cart get the same date from same place in local storage
* I set the getItem and setItem to contain the parameter, the key
* I it local storage key, so the carts will load from different keys in local storage and get different data

# Object oriented programmin has feature class, which is object generator
* Each object that we generate from the class is called instance

# We can also create constructor, wich let us run setup code after creating an object
* And code inside constructor will run automatically

# To avoid accidentally change of property, to avoid this class let us make property or method private
* It can be acces only in the class, and to do it private we type #
* So property withoud a # infront is called public property
* And we can make method loadFromLocalStorage private by typing #
