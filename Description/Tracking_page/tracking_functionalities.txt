# To create tracking progress i need dayjs
* First i create variable for today date, then i save the order time in variable
* And i create variable for delivery time 
* With all that variables i can create percent progress variable 

# Using that variable i can fill all progres labels in generate HTML section
* I set three cases, of the progress in less than 50%
* lesser of equal 50%, but less that 100 %
* And if the progress is lesser or equal 100% 

# In progress bar <div> i use style and insert the current percent progress
